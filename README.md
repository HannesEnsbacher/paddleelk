# Kayak & Canoe Rental Finder

A map-based web application for discovering kayak and canoe rental locations across Sweden, with a focus on small, often hard-to-find companies. Built as a personal project to explore MVP development, product thinking, and full-stack implementation.

## Project Background

I created this project after noticing how difficult it was to plan multi-day paddling trips in Sweden due to the fragmented online presence of small rental companies. This app aims to simplify that process by offering a centralized, user-friendly platform to explore rental locations via an interactive map.

In addition to it being a technical learning opportunity, it also served as a sandbox for applying concepts from my tech-based entrepreneurship master’s studies, such as:
- MVP-first development mindset
- Early user research and problem validation
- Lightweight agile planning and backlog management
- Leveraging AI tools to accelerate iteration

## Features

- 🗺️ Interactive map of curated rental locations (Mapbox)
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design
- 📊 Analytics and cookie consent integration
- 🛠️ MVP scope focused on usability and discoverability
- ⚙️ Supabase as the backend
- 🤖 AI-assisted development using tools like Vercel v0
